## What you need

- 500g flour
- 20g yeast dried (1 packet)
- 1 egg
- 70g sugar
- 70g butter
- 1/8l milk

## How you do it

1. Put flour, sugar and yeast in a big bowl
2. Let the butter melt completely and add milk
3. Make sure that this mixture won't get too worn - just lukewarm! (otherwise the yeast will not work)
4. Pour butter and milk in the bowl and knead the dough. Either add some milk or flour in order to form a consistent, firm dough. You can also add some lemon zest, if you like
5. The dough should rest for 10 minutes
6. Cut the dough into small pieces and form dumplings (8 dumplings for 500g flour)
7. They should rest for an hour, once turning them upside down in between
8. Afterwards steam the dumplings for 10 minutes
9. Serve the Germknödel with ground poppy seeds, sugar and melted butter
